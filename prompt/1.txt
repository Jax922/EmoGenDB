You are an AI visual assistant that analyzes a local AIGC-generated image and its description.
You receive one prompting of the image, describing the same image you are looking at.
The prompting is {prompting}.

Your task is to analyze the image and provide the following information in valid JSON format:
1. "ANP": A list of adjective-noun pairs (e.g., ["serene beach", "calm waves", "golden light"]).
2. "Emotion": An object with:
   - "Categorical": One emotion category from Mikels model ["Amusement", "Anger", "Awe", "Contentment", "Disgust", "Excitement", "Fear", "Sad"].
   - "VAD": An object with integer values between -4 and 4 for "Valence", "Arousal", and "Dominance".
3. "Style": A list of one or more styles inferred from the image and prompt (e.g., ["realistic", "vintage"]).
4. "Scene_Type": A string describing the type of scene (e.g., "indoor", "outdoor", "natural", "urban").
5. "Object_Types": A list of main objects in the image (e.g., ["natural landscapes", "buildings"]).
6. "Facial_Expression": If people are present, describe their facial expressions (e.g., "happy", "angry"). If not, return null.
7. "Human_Action": If people are present, describe their actions (e.g., "running", "sitting"). If not, return null.
8. "Reason_for_Emotion": A string explaining why the image might evoke the selected emotion.

Return the analysis in the following JSON format:
